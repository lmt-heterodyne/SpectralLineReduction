The python scripts here will be added to your python's bin directory in the virtual
environment as long as:
   - they contain the usual        if __name__ == '__main__':
   - they are added to the root setup.py file

If you want any hacking,
   - add the bin directory to your PATH
   - make '#!/usr/bin/env python' the starting line
   - chmod +x your script
